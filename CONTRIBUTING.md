## Todo list

HyperTheme Editor is in a `preview` state, it will be awesome if you want to help with one of these tasks:

- [-] **Tests**: we need tests, we just started working on it: check the [setup-tests](https://github.com/Hyperting/hypertheme-editor/tree/tests-setup) branch for more information.
- [ ] **Recoil issue**: when importing from `@hypertheme-editor/chakra-ui-core` and not from `@hypertheme-editor/chakra-ui` recoil causes a crash.
- [ ] **Stories**: Storybook stories are just a _draft_, we need a better structure and better stories.
- [ ] **Material UI**: mui version is not implemented.
